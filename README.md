I think it would be a good learning experience for me if i could somehow manage to do a side by side comparison with the recognition output of this script on one line and then the line below would show the the recognition output when i'm using dictation mode with dragonfly and kaldi active grammar. something along the lines of that anyway, and if not initially succeeding with that then just maybe exploring and learning how it works in the meantime
